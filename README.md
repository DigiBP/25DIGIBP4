# üìùüööüì¶ Introduction

Our project is a real-life process within a global food&beverage machinery manufacturer and is a key supporting process to the company¬¥s core sales process of selling food&beverage machinery including its repair and maintenance parts. This order-to-shipment process involves 4 departments and covers the work ranging from processing the purchase order (PO) to preparing and shipping the ordered goods. With over 600 customers and 2500 orderlines processed monthly, the process requires a close followup across all involved departments to fulfill custoemer orders as soon as possible as a main driver behind customer satisfaction.

# üß© Challanges of the Process

One of the major challenges is manual work related to the processing of PO and manual checks of goods availability which negatively affects the performance and efficiency. Process also relies on manual communication when checking the availability of orderd goods eespecially at the point when the goods availability check has been performed by cutomer service who, depending on the outcome of this availability check, must inform the relevant colleagues (either Procurement or Dispatch) to carry on with the execution of the process. Such level of manual and back-and-forth communication leads to a substantial amount of time spent on iterative and tidious messaging and ultimately generates time wastes especially if not followed up immediately by customer service or other departments. This might ultimately lead to dissatisfaction of customers and revenue losses.

For a breakdown of specific challenges relative to this process see the below overview. 

- **Fragmented and manual Communication**  
  Coordination between departments depends on manual notifications, leading to delays and errors.

- **Manual goods availability Check**  
  POs are received by email, validated, and entered into the system manually.

- **Inefficient Follow-Up**  
  Manual follow-ups are time-consuming and prone to being overlooked.

- **Lack of Workflow Automation**  
  The absence of automated decision-making especially in terms of checking the availability of ordered goods leads to unnecessary workload and time losses.
  
# üéØ Goal

Our goal is to transform the current process by introducing a partial automation that will lead to removing a substantial part of the workflow within Customer Service, specifically the need to carry out goods availability check manually while reducing the chance of possible human erros. Another improvement is the elimination of manual  coomunication 

# üì¶ AS-IS Process
* https://github.com/DigiBP/25DIGIBP4/blob/main/order_to_shipping_as-is_23_05.bpmn

This order-to-shipping process can be broken down into two main parts: (1) processing incoming POs and performing a goods availability and (2) preparing goods for shipment. as described, the first part involves several user tasks all of which involve non-automated workflow. (see tasks highlighted in green).

**Roles involved in the process**:

**Internal**
- Customer Service (CS): handles the incoming PO including the check of availability of ordered goods and informs other process participants of the outcome
- Procurement: involved in procuring ordered items which are out-of-stock
- Planner: involved in planning the production of out-of-stock items
- Dispatch: performs warehouse jobs (picking and packing) in preparation to shipping goods

**External**:
- Customer
- Vendor (interaction with vendors not modelled as it¬¥s out of scope of this project)

# TO-BE Process

As the company grows, we seek to **reduce the amount of user tasks and manual work** needed to perform them especially the goods availability check. By achieving this partial automation, we will save time for parties invovled that can be dedicated on continuos improvement elsewhere. Our process solution will introduce a pratial automation eliminating the need to check goods manually while also reducing manual communication.

Our Vision is not not only deliver a partial automation but also improve customer experience with the improved process.

We aim to:

- Reduce manual tasks
- Improve customer experience
- Save time for the customer service team
- Enable the team to focus on continuous improvement

# üí¨ Voiceflow Chatbot ‚Äì Digital Customer Support Assistant

As part of the digitalization of the Order-to-Cash process, a chatbot was implemented to handle customer inquiries related to order status. The solution is designed to reduce manual communication, improve response times, and enhance customer satisfaction. The chatbot also guides the customer through inquiries concerning the changing the order, the order process and return inquiries.
The chatbot enables customers to receive real-time answers on their questions by entering a valid order ID. It retrieves order information from Google Sheets databases. The chatbot operates through a voice or text interface and is accessible 24/7.

The benefits of offering a chatbot as a service include the following:
* Reduces manual workload for the Customer Service team
* Delivers consistent, fast, and reliable customer communication
* Enhances process transparency and customer satisfaction
* Easily scalable to cover additional services (e.g., delivery updates, FAQs)

The chatbot is complements the Camunda-driven digital process and MAKE automated process flow by serving as a human-centric interface at the customer touchpoint.

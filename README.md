# Project Goals

The goal of the assignment is to develop a solution that applies the DigiBP approach to a business process, demonstrating how digital technologies can improve process performance. 

# AS-IS Process

The Order-to-Cash process begins when a customer places an order via email directly with their assigned Customer Service (CS) agent. The CS agent manually opens SAP, fills in the order header, and — when available — uses a reference from a prior quotation to simplify order entry. If no quotation match is found, the agent must manually input all items into SAP. CS agents periodically check order statuses in SAP (without automated alerts) and request dispatch once the order is ready. For orders involving assembly (product type "F"), planners are involved. Throughout the process, CS agents manually track important information (e.g., orders without confirmed shipping dates) in Excel spreadsheets. Communication with customers regarding order status or delays is manual, and customers often inquire directly with CS agents.
